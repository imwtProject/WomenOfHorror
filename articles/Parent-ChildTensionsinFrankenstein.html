<p> Surely no one needs to be reminded that <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> is a book largely reminiscent of <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s own troubled family relationships; and
in support of the point, one need only turn to <span class="person" about="George Levine">George Levine</span> and
<span class="person" about="U. C. Knoepflmacher">U. C. Knoepflmacher</span>'s excellent collection of essays, <span class="literaryWork" about="The
Endurance of Frankenstein"><i>The Endurance of Frankenstein</i></span>, to find the matter well
documented.<a href="#1"><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></a>
That an author's life becomes translated into her fiction is
hardly news on any account. But what has somehow eluded proper
treatment is the resultant real subject of this "monster tale":
the failure of human beings to <q>parent</q> their offspring in such
a way that they will be able to take part in society rather than
retreat into themselves.<p>



An emphasis upon the proper assumption of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parental
responsibilities</span> was part of the age: <span class="person" about="Maria Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</span> and  <span class="person" about="Hannah
More">Hannah More</span> had, through their educational treatises, influenced <span class="person" about="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</span>'s <span class="literaryWork" about="Waverley">Waverley</span> themes,
and <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> in turn bowed in his direction by allowing her
husband to send him presentation volumes of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>
the month the novel was published anonymously. The romantic
educators typically placed the blame for an adolescent's
misconduct at the door of a negligent (though often
well-meaning) parent. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Shelley</span> herself subtly indicts <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s
parents in exactly this way; and she suggests an even subtler
subtext of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">family conflict</span> in the letters <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> writes to <span class="character" about="Margaret Saville">Margaret</span>. Previous commentators have, of course, noted 
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s abuse of his monster; strangely enough, however,
they have tended to ignore the precedent within his own family
for <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s later actions, as well as the familial tensions
that <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s shadow self, implies. Such critical
shortsightedness has inevitably resulted in textual analyses
that fail to account for the complexity of this novel.</p><p>



Readers have quite correctly assumed the statement in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Shelley</span>'s
preface, <q class="refOther">my chief concern has been to exhibit the amiableness
of domestic affection and the excellence of universal virtues</q>
to be a cover-up; but in ascribing to <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> a need to
deny the ugliness of a nightmarish vision they have missed her
real subterfuge.<a href="#2"><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup></a> She will indeed concern herself
with <span class="concept" about="parenthood"><q>domestic affection</q></span> -- but more precisely, the lack of it,
and how such a lack <i>undermines</i> <q>universal virtue.</q><a href="#3"><sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup></a> In <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Shelley</span>'s
attention to <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parent-child relationships</span>, she implies a
far-ranging application to society at large if we fail at this
most primal unit of communication, what hope is there for
compassionate interaction within the larger community? <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Shelley</span>
insists that man can live only through communion with others;
solitude, for her, represents death.</p><p>

<a name="par7"><!-- 7 --></a>

Through his continual exaggerations of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">familial love</span>,<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor
Frankenstein</span> reveals to us the inadequacy of the homelife that
belies his oft-fevered protestations of attachment. Perhaps the
inevitable ambivalence concerning our own childhood creates a
suspension of critical acuity in our reading <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s story, but
a close study of the text undercuts severely his insistence upon
the perfect home. Critics have generally fallen for his
defenses: <span class="person" about="Kate Ellis">Kate Ellis</span> basically accepts his myth of the happy
home;<a href="#4"><sup><font size="-1">4</font></sup></a> <span class="person" about="Susan Gubar">Gubar</span>
and <span class="person" about="Sandra M. Gilbert">Gilbert</span> call his childhood, in Miltonic terms, Edenic.<a href="#5"><sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup></a> Only
<span class="person" about="Christopher Small">Christopher Small</span> suggests that in <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s description there is
a <q class="refOther">strained emphasis on felicity.</q><a href="#6"><sup><font size="-1">6</font></sup></a></p><p>

<a name="par8"><!-- 8 --></a>

That <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> insists upon remembering "the best of all possible
worlds" is the psychological defense of an only child (as he was
for a long time) who maintains a <span class="concept" about="parenthood">love/hate relationship with his
parents</span> because he senses that they share an affection that in
some way excludes him.<a href="#7"><sup><font size="-1">7</font></sup></a> <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> is an object of their love,
not a participant in it; he is <q class="refFrankenstein">their plaything and their idol</q>
(p. 33). In his
recollections of his parents' relationship recollections more
fully developed in the 1831 edition -- he emphasizes their
devotion to each other, to the (implicit) detriment of their
child. If, as <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> claims, everything was centered on
fulfilling the mother's wishes, one must wonder at the son's
extravagant account of the love left over for him: <q class="refFrankenstein">they seemed
to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of
love to bestow them upon me</q> (p.
33). The narrator strains his credibility too far when he
assures us that <q class="refFrankenstein">every hour of my infant life I received a
lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control</q> (p. 34) -- precisely those
virtues that the young adult scientist will lack. After being
told that <q class="refFrankenstein">for a long time I was their only care</q> we are to
believe that the addition of <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span> to his little  family
effected nothing but unqualified joy. There is no mention of the
inevitable sibling friction; instead, these siblings were
<q class="refFrankenstein">strangers to any species of disunion or disrepute. Harmony was
the soul of companionship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (p. 36). <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> early on
models upon his parents as <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span> becomes <i>his</i>
plaything. His mother tells him, <q class="refFrankenstein">I have a pretty present for my
Victor -- tomorrow he shall have <i>it</i></q> (p. 35, emphasis mine). The child
subsequently accepts <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span> as his "promised gift" and makes
her his own possession.</p><p>

<a name="par9"><!-- 9 --></a>

We misread the story (and many have) if we listen to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s
hyperbolic descriptions of a family idyll without attuning our
ears to the subtext. When, for instance, <span class="character" about="Henry Clerval">Henry Clerval</span> asks
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> if they might talk "on an important subject" and <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>
reacts with some anxiety, his friend quickly surmises that the
scientist might be fearful to speak of his own home. Before
proceeding, <span class="character" about="Henry Clerval">Clerval</span> reassures his friend: <q class="refFrankenstein">I will not mention it
if it agitates you; but your father and cousin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long
silence </q>(p. 63). <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>
responds: <q class="refFrankenstein">How could you suppose that my first thought would not
fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so
deserving of my love?</q> Both <span class="character" about="Henry Clerval">Clerval</span> and the readers have some
reason to doubt <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s insistence. At this point in the
narrative, he has not been home for five years; he will finally
return home after yet another year passes, when he is summoned
by his father upon <span class="character" about="William Frankenstein">William</span>'s death. Consequently, though he
proclaims in frenzied terms that he loves his family <q>to
adoration</q>, we suspect that ambivalence, at the least, subverts
his affection.</p><p>

<a name="par10"><!-- 10 --></a>

It is not only <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> who has troubled connections with his
family; rather, <span class="concept" about="parenthood">we are in a world where parental
irresponsibility and failure are the rule</span>. Beaufort's pride puts
his daughter in a difficult position; <span class="character" about="Safie">Safie</span>'s interests are
betrayed by her father; <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span> is left an orphan; <span class="character" about="Justine Moritz">Justine</span>'s
father dies and leaves his favorite at the mercy of a hard
mother; and <span class="character" about="Henry Clerval">Henry Clerval</span>'s father attempts to keep him from the
academic life he yearns to pursue. But more important than any
family conflicts outside of the protagonist's is <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>'s
relationship to <span class="character" about="Margaret Saville">Margaret</span>, that maternal sister who has
apparently failed to be responsive to her younger brother's
needs. He somewhat cynically reminds her, for instance, that of
his efforts at poetry, she is <q class="refFrankenstein">well acquainted with my failure
and how heavily I bore the disappointment</q> (p. 17); and then,
when discussing his latest venture, he implores: <q class="refFrankenstein">And now, dear
Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, that some encouraging voice could answer in
the affirmative! </q>(p. 17).
Upon close reading we sense a compulsion on <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>'s part to
prove himself to <span class="character" about="Margaret Saville">Margaret</span>; and if we ignore this underlying
theme, as critics traditionally have done, we miss the emphasis
in the novel on the murky undercurrents of what look at first
glance to be straightforward parent-child relationships. In one
sense, then, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s exaggerated (and therefore unmistakable)
neglect of his progeny serves merely as a bolder-than-life
projection of the novel's other, more oblique family
conflicts.</p><p>

<a name="par11"><!-- 11 --></a>

<span class="concept" about="parenthood">The parental failures are emblematic</span> for those people
unwilling to fulfill their duties to society at large: just as
the hunter, that mythical image of a strong and protective
father, reacts incorrectly and injures his charge's rescuer, so
even the priestly fathers respond insensitively to their
children's needs.<a href="#8"><sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup></a> <span class="character" about="Justine Moritz">Justine</span>'s callous mother follows
her confessor's advice in removing her daughter from the
surrogate family where she is happy (p. 66); and when <span class="character" about="Justine Moritz">Justine</span> is
accused of murdering <span class="character" about="William Frankenstein">William</span>, her priest helps condemn this
innocent by threatening her into a false confession of guilt (p. 87). Even the De Laceys, who
represent the family most at ease with itself, fail; De Lacey, a
parent who is treated with the greatest deference and respect,
responds compassionately to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s child because he is
blind and therefore not prejudiced by appearances. It is,
ironically, when his sighted children return that the old man
excludes the monster from a chance of kinship; it is when his
children enable their father to <q>see through their eyes</q> that he
loses his own visionary powers.</p><p>

<a name="par12"><!-- 12 --></a>

If, as <span class="person" about="Ellen Moers">Ellen Moers</span> has suggested, <q class="refOther">most of the novel -- two of
the three volumes, can be said to deal with the retribution
visited upon the monster and creator for deficient infant
care,</q><a href="#9"><sup><font size="-1">9</font></sup></a> it is
also true that <span class="concept" about="parenthood">inadequate parental guidance </span> in later years
leaves its mark on <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>. The young scientist is
thirteen, on the threshold of adolescence, when the struggle to
break free of his parents and to become his own man begins in
earnest. Not all fathers
welcome their child's ascendant power, with its accompanying
suggestion that their own is on the wane. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>
implicates this tension through her fascination with <q class="refFrankenstein">the tale
of the sinful founder of his race whose miserable doom it was to
bestow the kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated
house, just when they reached the age of promise</q> (p. 7). She revised the second
version of her novel to emphasize <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s lack of important
formative stage; the first version allows the elder share his
son's interest in science, whereas in the second, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> is left
on his own.<a href="#10"><sup><font size="-1">10</font></sup></a> In fact, when the exuberant youth
tries to discuss his reading with his father, <span class="character" about="Alphonse
Frankenstein">Alphonse
Frankenstein</span> carelessly glances at the title page and exclaims,
<q class="refFrankenstein">My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad
trash </q>(p. 39). In one of
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s rare insightful reflections, he explicitly criticizes
his father's execution of his parental role: <q class="refFrankenstein">If .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
my father had taken the pains to explain to me [modern science]
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is even possible that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my
ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my
ruin </q>(p. 39). Instead, he
was abandoned <q class="refFrankenstein">to struggle with a child's
blindness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (p. 39). Finally, he is left
mingling <q class="refFrankenstein">a thousand contradictory theories and floundering
desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge,</q> guided
by <q>childish reasoning</q> (p.
40).</p><p>

<a name="par13"><!-- 13 --></a>

<span class="person" about="John Dussinger">John Dussinger</span> has perceptively suggested that <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s
academic pursuit is a rebellion against the<span class="concept" about="parenthood">moral obligations
between father and son </span> : <q class="refFrankenstein">The center of evil is parental
irresponsibility and selfishness, and the ideal  of goodness
is the father's bond to his son and the reciprocal bond of son
to father.</q><a href="#11"><sup><font size="-1">11</font></sup></a> Before there can be an interplay
of love between father and child, the father has to fulfill his
duties, a contract <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> well knew from her mother's
writings. She also understood the pain of being rejected when
her activities earned her father's disapproval, such as his
refusal to see her after her marriage to Shelley or his callous
warning not to grieve in excess for her dead child, lest she
lose the love of those close to her.<a href="#12"><sup><font size="-1">12</font></sup></a></p><p>

<a name="par14"><!-- 14 --></a>

Just as <span class="person" about="William Godwin">William Godwin</span>  steamrolled over his daughter's
sensibilities, so <span class="character" about="Alphonse
Frankenstein">Alphonse
Frankenstein</span> too was insensitive to
his son. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> implies, for example, that his father insists
that he depart for <span class="places" about="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</span> soon after his mother's death,
away from the sympathy of his native country and into new,
strange surroundings with no one to guide him. There is the
suggestion that <span class="character" about="Alphonse
Frankenstein">Alphonse
</span> disapproves of his son's grief as a
dilatory tactic. In fact, strong sense of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parental disapproval</span>
informs the father/son reactions throughout the novel. Indeed,
as <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> describes his father, we come to see a parent who
loves only conditionally: his justice is a <q>virtue</q> which
renders it necessary <q class="refFrankenstein">that he should approve highly to love
strongly</q> (p. 33).</p><p>

<a name="par15"><!-- 15 --></a>

The need to win approval from <span class="concept" about="parenthood">judgmental parents</span> can at times
compel the child toward excellence; but it can also be perverted
into disastrous extremes, in which the child transforms his
Promethean aspirations for success into those of overreaching
and surpassing his parents at the cost of everything else.
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> has ambitiously planned that <q class="refFrankenstein">a new species would bless
me as its creator and source .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No father would
claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should
deserve theirs.</q> That after the "birth" he feels "guilty of a
crime" comes, therefore, as no surprise to us -- he has usurped
his father's place in the hierarchy. No wonder then that he
finds his interior self <q class="refFrankenstein"> in a state of insurrection and turmoil</q>
(p. 48). His father had taken
great precautions to ensure that his son disdain supernatural
horrors (p. 55); yet,
regardless of his disclaimer of responsibility for his creation,
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> deliberately chose the form for his <span class="character" about="the creature">creature</span> that
was sure to provoke the most horror and dread in other mortals.
<span class="person" about="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</span> typifies those readers who gloss over
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s foreknowledge of his <span class="character" about="the creature">creature</span>'s ugliness, when he
asserts: <q class="refOther">the hideousness of his creature was no part of Victor
Frankenstein's intention&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q><a href="#13"><sup><font size="-1">13</font></sup></a> Instead, we
must read <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span>'s shock at his child's ugliness as mere
repression of the truth, as he unwittingly admits: <q class="refFrankenstein">I had gazed
on him while unfinished; <i>he was ugly
then</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (p. 58, emphasis mine).</p><p>

<a name="par16"><!-- 16 --></a>

<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> compensates for the sense of smallness his father has
imparted by <span class="concept" about="parenthood">usurping his parents' powers</span> as creators, but also
by issuing forth a child whose physical nature will be inferior,
in size, to no one. He acts out his anger at his family in an
attempt to affirm his own selfhood. Just as he threw the door
open to find <q>a spectre,</q> so he exorcises the wolf under his
bed, the parent as evil predator, by <span class="concept" about="monstruosity">creating his own nightmare</span>
come true.<a href="#14"><sup><font size="-1">14</font></sup></a>
He recognizes from his progeny's first murderous act that the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s destruc-  tion is his own: <q class="refFrankenstein">I was the true
murderer</q> (p. 89). By the end of the novel he has acknowledged
that he is responsible for all the deaths. He admits: <q class="refFrankenstein">I
abhorred the face of man,</q> a statement he fearfully retracts
with <q class="refFrankenstein"> oh, not abhorred! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt attracted even to
the most repulsive among them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (pp. 184-85), a reflection we
can hardly credit. Instead, his exclamation that he has turned a
murderer loose upon society (p.
200) indicates the truer self-knowledge.</p><p>

<a name="par17"><!-- 17 --></a>

But <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> is not alone in needing to dethrone his
parents. <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>, that too often forgotten character who frames
the novel subtly strikes out at <span class="character" about="Margaret Saville">Margaret</span>, the sister who helped
rear him. He reminds his sister again and again of his imminent
destruction, and he presages pain for her whatever the outcome
of his <q>voyage of discovery,</q> as he continually alludes to his
journey: <q class="refFrankenstein">If I succeed, many years will pass before meeting
again; if I fail, you will never see me again </q>(p. 18). In a
sense he tries to "kill" his parent too, in tones redolent of
the monster: <q class="refFrankenstein">You will have visitings of despair, and yet be
tortured by hope</q> (pp.
212-13).</p><p>

<a name="par18"><!-- 18 --></a>

<span class="character" about="Margaret Saville">Margaret</span>, his mother substitute, has regarded his voyage with
evil forebodings (p. 15),
but <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> insists on his vision: <q class="refFrankenstein">you cannot contest the
inestimable benefits which I shall confer on all mankind, to the
last generation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </q>(p. 16). Since learning of his
father's injunction against a seafaring life, the son has waited
for his chance to disobey: <q class="refFrankenstein">the favorite dream of my early years
was this voyage </q>(p. 16).
<span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>'s very uneasy relationship with his sister has been too
often overlooked; his letters to her are usually thinly veiled
threats to her power, attempts to assert his own autonomy.<a href="#15"><sup><font size="-1">15</font></sup></a>Indeed, this
<q>voyage of discovery</q> is, for him, a fight, in the Ericksonian
schema,<a href="#16"><sup><font size="-1">16</font></sup></a>
between dependence and autonomy, an effort on his part to
determine his relationship to the rest of society. If he, in the
end, falls short of the godlike aspirations that, he emphasizes,
<q>lift his soul to heaven,</q> he will also turn back, however
reluctantly, toward a finally integrated <span class="concept" about="parenthood">relationship between
parent and child</span>. <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> will <q>grow up,</q> affirm himself, and
return to his community, unlike his counterpart, that "soul
mate" in whom he so tightly sees his own potential reflected.

<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>'s role as father is intensified by that
fulfillment of every parent's dream: he can deliberately,
knowingly create his child; he can actually choose the
parts. It is especially ironic, then, that he hates what he
sees. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> produces such a grotesque model for his
procreation in part as a response to his own aggressive feelings
toward his parents and the guilt these emotions provoke. He is
anxious throughout the gestation period: <q class="refFrankenstein">Every night I was
oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
painful degree </q>(p. 56).
Consequently, he has geared himself to hate and fear his
<span class="character" about="the creature">creature</span>. In one sense, the ugliness affords him an escape from
<span class="concept" about="parenthood">parental responsibilities</span>; he can justify his immediate flight.
After proving his godlike power to produce life, he is then able
immediately to abandon it.<p>

<a name="par20"><!-- 20 --></a>

It is not, however, that <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span> is unaware of
familial connection to his <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>; he feels what the duties of
a <q>creator towards the creature</q> are, but he nonetheless makes
no attempt to satisfy the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s needs. He recognizes, <q class="refFrankenstein">I
ought to [have rendered] him happy before I complained of his
wickedness </q>(p. 102). At one
point the monster's tale of his life allows <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span> to
offer his conditional concern, judging, in the manner of his
father, his progeny worthy of attention: <q class="refFrankenstein"> His tale, and the
feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine
sensations; and did I not as his maker, owe him, all the portion
of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? </q>(p. 146). He continues to fail
his <span class="character" about="the creature">creature</span>, however, never gaining insight into the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s
tortured psyche, so that at the end of the novel he is able to
exclaim without irony: <q class="refFrankenstein">Let the cursed and hellish monster drink
deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me</q>
(p. 202).</p><p>

<a name="par21"><!-- 21 --></a>

In noting <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>'s brutal disregard of any <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parental
duties</span>, we should recall his analysis of his parents' reaction
to him as a child: <q class="refFrankenstein">It was in their hands to direct to happiness
or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties to me.</q> They
had a <q class="refFrankenstein">deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to
which they had given life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (p. 34). In reality, however, his
parents had regarded him as a plaything, a bauble (p. 33); and so <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>
views his creation as an object of his pleasure, until the
"newborn" forces his way into his parent's consciousness.</p><p>

<a name="par22"><!-- 22 --></a>

It is also worth noting here that<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> began her writing
with Chapter 4, wherein we see the father rejecting the
monster's outstretched hand.<a href="#17"><sup><font size="-1">17</font></sup></a> The <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> labors under no
delusion that he is loved: <q class="refFrankenstein">You, my own creator, detest and
spurn me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q>(p. 99). In response to the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s pain, his father notices that <q class="refFrankenstein">his countenance bespoke
bitter anguish," but its "unearthly ugliness rendered it almost

of <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span>'s parental advice:<q class="refOther"> A right always

condemns him as <q class="refFrankenstein"> the author at once of my existence and its
unspeakable torments </q> (p.
220). It is no coincidence that the portrait of <span class="character" about="Caroline Beaufort Frankenstein"> Caroline</span>
kneeling, in agony, by her father's coffin is echoed at the
novel's end, where the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>, in his own agony of despair,
hangs over his dead father and utters exclamations of grief and
horror. <span class="character" about="Caroline Beaufort Frankenstein"> Caroline</span>'s beauty ensures that her portrait will elicit
a strong sympathy from <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>, but the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> has no such
saving grace. Thus, with his arm extended yet again to his
maker, he admits the impossibility of contact.</p><p>

<a name="par23"><!-- 23 --></a>

To substitute for the lack of human connection, the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>
revels in self-education. He
recognizes the wonders of speech, in which, unlike those around
him, he locates mysterious powers. Viewing language as<q class="refFrankenstein"> a
godlike science </q>(p. 112), he
pays rapt attention to the lessons <span class="character" about="Felix De Lacey ">Felix</span> offers to <span class="character" about="Safie">Safie</span>.
Through the De Laceys he learns that man is <q class="refFrankenstein">at once so
powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base</q>
(p. 119). Unlike his creator,
who ponders meaning only insofar as its suggests power, the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> learns what life is about. He absorbs <span class="character" about="Felix De Lacey ">Felix</span>'s lessons.
<q class="refFrankenstein">I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They
produced in me an infinity of new images and
feelings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (p. 128). His lessons lead him,
finally, to that question of intense psychological importance,
without which the child never becomes the man; he tells his
"father" that he finally asked himself <q class="refFrankenstein">Who was I? (p. 128).<q class="refFrankenstein"> The path of my
departure was free; and there was none to lament my annihilation
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What was I? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What was my
destination?</q> (p. 128). It
is worth quoting here at length from <span class="person" about="Bruno Bettelheim">Bruno Bettelheim</span>'s
analogous description of a child's self-discovery.

</p><blockquote class="refOther">

The child asks himself: "Who am I? Where did I come from?

wonders who or what projects him into adversity, and what can
prevent this from happening to him. Are there benevolent powers
in addition to his parents? Are his parents benevolent powers?
How should he form himself, and why? Is there hope for him

him?<a href="#19"><sup><font size="-1">19</font></sup></a>

The tragedy is that for this introspective wanderer, the world
will not support his answer; he will be answered only <q>with
groans</q> (p. 121).
Psychiatrist <span class="person" about="Selma Fraiberg">Selma Fraiberg</span>, in <span class="literaryWork" about="Every Child's Birthright"><i>Every Child's Birthright</i></span>,
writes that the unnurtured, unloved child grows into the
aberrant adult -- the criminal who seeks to negate his
overwhelming sense of nothingness by inflicting pain on others
-- a scream that <q class="refFrankenstein">I exist, I am.</q><a href="#20"><sup><font size="-1">20</font></sup></a> It is not, then, the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s
nature that makes him so vengeful, as his creator deludes
himself into thinking, but rather his overwhelming sense of
isolation and despair at lacking human connections that in fact
his father should have first provided. At the time of his first
violent act, he is merely seeking fellowship with another human,
and he assumes little <span class="character" about="William Frankenstein">William</span>, the <q>beautiful child</q> so unlike
himself, to be too young to have formed prejudices based on
appearance. Enraged to the point of murder, he is motivated
by a combination of being rejected by one so young and finding
that the child, related to the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s creator, is yet another
agent of sorrow by the scientist's hand. Similarly, he strikes
out at <span class="character" about="Justine Moritz">Justine</span> because she represents to him the relationships
he can never have: her condemnation will therefore be <q>just</q>
because <q class="refFrankenstein">the crime had its source in her; be hers the
punishment </q>(p. 144). By
issuing the ultimatum to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>, <q class="refFrankenstein">On you it rests, whether
I quit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. man and lead a harmless life, or become
the scourge of your fellow creatures </q>(p. 101), the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> places the
blame for his aggression where it properly lies. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>
refuses the responsibility, and so, as <span class="person" about="U. C. Knoepflmacher">U. C. Knoepflmacher</span>
observes in a different context, <q class="refOther">The monster becomes father to
the man and relentlessly imposes on its creator the same
conditions of dependence and insecurity that it was made to
suffer.</q><a href="#21"><sup><font size="-1">21</font></sup></a><p>

<a name="par24"><!-- 24 --></a>

In a last desperate attempt to evoke a one-to-one response, the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> forces his master into the Arctic race where he assures
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span>, <q class="refFrankenstein">You will feel the misery of cold and frost, to
which I am impassive</q> (p.
204). The cold serves as a metaphor for the comfortless,
solitary life he has led, one he is bent on recreating for the
agent of his pain. We become intensely, painfully aware of the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s motivation for his aggression through the death scene
of his father. Through the grief and horror at his successful
patricidal act emerges the typical, unfathomable loyalty of the
abused child: <q class="refFrankenstein">Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted
being! I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. destroyed thee by destroying all thou
lovedst.</q> But the larger, more deadly truth about this
<q>self-devoted being</q> is unwittingly echoed in his child's last
suffocated observation:<q class="refFrankenstein"> Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me</q>
(p. 219).

Of major significance in the struggle between <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span> and
his <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> are the efforts of the creator to escape his place
in society, in contrast to the desperate attempts of the created
to become situated within it. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span> relates that his
early life was passed in considerable seclusion; that it became
his temper to avoid a crowd, a withdrawal making him
"indifferent," therefore, to his "school-fellows in general" (p. 37). His apprehension at
leaving his "amiable companions" of the hearth for the new
territory of <span class="places" about="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</span> is
well rounded, since he will be more alone here than ever. He
creates his  <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> in solitude; and after the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>
kills <span class="character" about="William Frankenstein">William</span>, the scientist can justify his alienation from
mankind by reason of his grief. He now shuns the face of man:
<q class="refFrankenstein">all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was
my only consolation -- deep, dark, deathlike solitude</q> (p. 90). His father senses a
hidden meaning to his son's withdrawal, ostensibly due to his
mourning, and warns him that <q class="refFrankenstein">excessive sorrow prevents
improvement of enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily
usefulness, without which no man is fit for society </q>(p. 91). The truth is the blunt
reality previously noted: <q>I abhorred society.</q> <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor</span> wishes to
pass his life on that <q class="refFrankenstein">barren rock</q> (p. 169) where he will be
uninterrupted by the pain of human contact; in contrast with
Prometheus, whose bondage was a sacrificial act for the good of
all mankind, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein"> Frankenstein</span> wants to protect himself from the
weariness of social intercourse.<p>

<a name="par27"><!-- 27 --></a>

In direct opposition to his maker, the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> longs for society
and sympathy. He quickly becomes aware that there is no place
for him, that he has been forbidden all that society holds
dear: wealth and connections. If his own creator withholds from
him human contact, he can expect nothing more from the rest of
his world. He realizes: <q class="refFrankenstein">No sympathy may I ever find.</q> Though
his vain efforts to assert his selfhood through aggressive acts
have ruined him, he realizes his depravity is the fault of man:
<q class="refFrankenstein">the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy
of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I
am alone. </q>All humankind has sinned against him (p. 221). In the tradition of
those who, regardless of their sins, know passion and thus know
life, the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> will exult in self-destruction by fire.
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> instead will die passively, <q class="refFrankenstein">a fit end for a being
who has never achieved a full sense of another's existence.</q><a href="#23"><sup><font size="-1">23</font></sup></a></p><p>

If <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> offers us both <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> and his <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> as
societal members who serve only to subvert civilization, she
suggest in <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Robert Walton</span>. a resolution of the conflict between
ambition and the need for intimacy which will result in a
balanced world. <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> knows from the beginning of his trip that
he is undergoing a rite of passage, a journey of discovery. We
recognize a potential <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>, another man ill at ease with
family life, seeking out ultimate knowledge by conquering the
world's uncharted regions. Indeed,"<span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> claims <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> as
his soul mate, and the scientist acts out the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s role of
<span class="concept" about="monstruosity">deviant self</span>deviant self, the other half, as he tempts <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> to continue
his ill-fated voyage to the <span class="place" about="Pole">Pole</span>. What distinguishes <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> from
his counterpart, however, is his nascent sense of responsibility
to his larger family aboard ship. In worrying about the
difficulties of the voyage, he realizes he will need to be
responsive to his men's fears; he <q class="refFrankenstein">must raise the spirits of
others</q>as well as sustain his own (p. 17). His description of his
two favorite subordinates reflects the weaknesses they share
with the novel's major characters: the lieutenant is <q class="refFrankenstein">madly
desirous of glory and the ship's master has experienced a "youth
passed in solitude</q> which by  now we recognize to be a clear
danger. <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> will, however, in fulfilling his <q class="refFrankenstein"> moral
responsibility to the family,</q> steer them clear of danger.</p><p>

His sailors instinctively assume the protectorship of their

fail them. They tell <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>, <q class="refFrankenstein">Here is our captain, and he
will not allow you to perish in the open sea</q> (p. 24). Indeed, even as <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>
carefully absorbs <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s story -- a story that will help
vicariously to redeem the captain's solipsistic quest--he
ministers to the sick man. Although in a literal sense not true,
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s acclamation to <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> that "you have restored me
to life" suggests the strange interchange whereby <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>
fulfills properly <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s quest for knowledge as well as
assuming a paternal role toward the progeny of that quest. In
spite of his horror at the <span class="concept" about="monstruosity">"appalling hideousness"</span> of
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s <span class="character" about="the creature">creature</span>, <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> takes the redemptive step that
no one else in society has been willing to take, and, magically,
calls on him <i>to stay</i> (p.
219, emphasis mine). The <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> is transfixed; he looks on
with wonder at the person who will finally acknowledge his
outstretched hand.</p><p>

<span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>'s voyage of discovery ends, then, in his, assuming
responsibilities of the mature adult, the man who turns back to
society away from goals benefiting only the self, toward the
goal of communion with others. He forswears his self-pity at
having been a neglected child, a parentless boy, and takes on
fully the role of parent himself -- to the <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> (he listens),
and to his men (he turns back). As <span class="person" about="J. M. Hill">J. M. Hill</span> remarks:<q class="refOther"> He

his <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>, of Satanic aspirations. It is, perhaps, a
