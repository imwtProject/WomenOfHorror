<h1>My Monster/My Self</h1>
<p class="byline"><i>by Barbara Johnson</i></p>





<p>To judge from recent trends in scholarly as well as popular
literature, three crucial questions can be seen to stand at the
forefront of today's preoccupations: the question of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mothering</span>,
the question of the <span class="concept" about="gender">woman writer</span>, and the question of <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>. Although these questions and current discussions
of them often appear unrelated to each other, it is my intention
here to explore some ways in which the three questions are
profoundly interrelated, and to attempt to shed new light on
each by approaching it via the others. I shall base my remarks
upon two twentieth-century theoretical studies -- <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span>'s
<span class="literaryWork" about="My Mother/My Self"><i>My Mother/My Self</i></span> and <span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dorothy Dinnerstein</span>'s 
<span class="literaryWork" about="The Mermaid and the Minotaur"><i>The Mermaid and the Minotaur</i></span> and one nineteenth-century <span class="concept" about="gothic">gothic</span> novel, <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein; Or, the Modern Prometheus</i></span>, written by <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary
Shelley</span>, whose importance for literary history has until quite
recently been considered to arise not from her own writings but from the fact that she was the second wife of poet <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Percy 
Bysshe Shelley</span> and
the daughter of political philosopher <span class="person" about="William Godwin">William Godwin</span> and pioneering
feminist <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary
Wollstonecraft</span>.</p>


<p>All three of these books, in strikingly diverse ways, offer a
critique of the institution of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parenthood</span>. <span class="literaryWork" about="The Mermaid and the Minotaur"><i>The Mermaid and
the Minotaur</i></span> is an analysis of the damaging effects of the
fact that human infants are cared for almost exclusively by
women. <q class="refOther">What the book's title as a whole is meant to connote,</q>
writes <span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span>, <q class="refOther">is both (a) our longstanding general
awareness of our uneasy, ambiguous position in the animal
kingdom, and (b) a more specific awareness: that until we grow
strong enough to renounce the pernicious forms of collaboration
between the sexes, both man and woman will remain semi-human,
<span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrous</span></q> [p. 5]. Even as <span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span> describes convincingly
the types of imbalance and injustice the prevailing asymmetry in
gender relations produces, she also analyzes the reasons for our
refusal to abandon the very modes of <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> from which we
suffer most. <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span>'s book, which is subtitled "A
Daughter's Search for Identity," argues that the mother's
repression of herself necessitated by the <span class="concept" about="motherhood">myth of maternal love</span>
creates a heritage of self-rejection, anger, and duplicity that
makes it difficult for the daughter to seek any emotional
satisfaction other than the state of idealized symbiosis that
both mother and daughter continue to punish themselves for never
having been able to achieve. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>
is an even more elaborate and unsettling formulation of the
relation between <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parenthood</span> and <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span>. It is the story of two antithetical modes of parenting that give rise to
two increasingly parallel lives -- the life of <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>, who is the beloved child of two doting parents,
and the life of <span class="character" about="the creature">the monster</span> he single-handedly creates, who is
immediately spurned and abandoned by his creator. The fact that in the end both characters reach an equal degree of alienation
and self-torture and indeed become indistinguishable as they
pursue each other across the frozen polar wastes indicates that
the novel is, among other things, a study of the impossibility
of finding an adequate model for what a <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parent</span> should be.</p>


<p>All three books agree, then, that in the existing state of things there is something inherently <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrous</span> about the
prevailing parental arrangements. While Friday and Dinnerstein,
whose analyses directly address the problem of sexual
difference, suggest that this <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> is curable, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary
Shelley</span> who does not explicitly locate the self's <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span>
in its gender arrangements, appears to dramatize divisions
within the human being that are so much a part of being human
that no escape from <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> seems possible.</p>


<p>What I will try to do here is to read these three books not as
mere <i>studies</i> of the <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> of selfhood, not as
mere accounts of human monsterdom in general, but precisely as
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographies</span> in their own right, as textual dramatizations of
the very problems with which they deal. None of the three books,
of course, presents itself explicitly as <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>. Yet each
includes clear moments of employment of the a<span class="concept" about="autobiography">utobiographical</span>,
not the purely authorial first-person pronoun. In each case the
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographical</span> reflex is triggered by the resistance and
ambivalence involved in the very writing of the book. What I
shall argue here is that what is specifically feminist in each
book is directly related to this struggle for <span class="concept" about="gender">feminine
authorship</span>.</p>


<p>The notion that <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> can somehow be read as the
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> of a woman would certainly appear at first sight
to be ludicrous. The novel, indeed, presents not one but
<i>three</i> <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographies</span> of men. <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Robert Walton</span>, an arctic
explorer on his way to the <span class="place" about="North Pole">North Pole</span>, writes home to his sister
of his encounter with <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>, who tells <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> the
story of his painstaking creation and unexplained abandonment of
a <span class="character" about="the creature">nameless monster</span> who suffers excruciating and fiendish
loneliness, and who tells <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> his life story in the
middle pages of the book. The three male <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographies</span>
motivate themselves as follows:

<blockquote class="refFrankenstein">
<span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>(to his <span class="character" about="Margaret Walton Saville">sister</span>): <q>You will rejoice to hear that no
disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which
you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here
yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my
welfare.</q> [p. 15]<br>

<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> (with his hands covering his face, to <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>, who
has been speaking of his scientific ambition): <q>Unhappy man! Do
you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating
draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the
cup from your lips!</q> [p.26]<br>

<span class="character" about="the creature">Monster</span> (to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>): <q>I entreat you to hear me before you
give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.</q> [<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>:]
<q>Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between
you and me [...]</q> [<span class="character" about="the creature">Monster</span> places his hands before
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s eyes]: <q>Thus I take from thee a sight which you
abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion
... God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring,
after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more
horrid even from the very resemblance.</q> [pp. 95, 96, 97, 125]<br>
</blockquote>

All three <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographies</span> here are clearly attempts at
persuasion rather than simple accounts of facts. They all depend on a presupposition of <i>resemblance</i> between teller and
addressee: <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> assures his <span class="character" about="Margaret Walton Saville">sister</span> that he has not really left
the path she would wish for him, that he still resembles her.
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> recognizes in <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> an image of himself and
rejects in <span class="character" about="the creature">the monster</span> a resemblance he does not wish to
acknowledge. The teller is in each case speaking into a mirror of his own transgression. The tale is designed to reinforce the
resemblance between teller and listener so that somehow transgression can be eliminated, Yet the desire for resemblance,
the desire to create a being like oneself -- which is the <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographical</span> desire par excellence -- is also the
<i>central</i> transgression in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel. What is
at stake in <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s workshop of filthy creation is
precisely the possibility of shaping a life in one's own image:
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> can thus be seen as a figure for
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> as such. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>, then, has twice
obeyed the impulse to construct an image of himself: on the first occasion he creates a monster, and on the second he tries
to explain to <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span> the causes and consequences of the first.
Frankenstein can be read as the story of <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> as the
attempt to neutralize the <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrosity</span> of <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>.
Simultaneously a revelation and a coverup, <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> would
appear to constitute itself as in some way a repression of
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>.</p>

<p>These three fictive male autobiographies are embedded within a
thin introductory frame, added in 1831, in which <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> herself makes the repression of her own <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographical</span> impulse
explicit:

<blockquote class="refFrankenstein">
The publishers of the standard novels, in selecting Frankenstein
for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish
them with some account of the origin of the story.
[...] It is true that I am very averse to bringing
myself forward in print, but as my account will only appear as
an appendage to a former production, and as it will be confined
to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I
can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion. [p. vii]
</blockquote>

<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>, here, rather than speaking <i>into</i> a mirror,
is speaking as an appendage to a text. It might perhaps be
instructive to ask whether this change of status has anything to
do with the problem of specifically <span class="concept" about="gender"><i>feminine</i></span>
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>. In a humanistic tradition in which man is the
measure of all things, how does an appendage go about telling
the story of her life?</p>


<p>Before pursuing this question further, I would like to turn to a
more explicit version of surreptitious <span class="concept" about="gender">feminine</span> <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>.
Of the three books under discussion, <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span>'s account of
the <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother/daughter relationship</span> relies the most heavily on the
facts of the author's life in order to demonstrate its thesis.
Since the author grew up without a father, she shares with
Frankenstein's <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span> some of the problems of coming from a
<span class="concept" about="parenthood">single-parent</span> household. The book begins with a chapter entitled
<q>Mother Love</q>, of which the first two sentences are: <q class="refOther">I have
always lied to my mother. And she to me</q> [p. 19]. Interestingly,
the book carries the following dedication: <q class="refOther">When I stopped
seeing my mother with the eyes of a child, I saw the woman who
helped me give birth to myself. This book is for Jane Colbert
Friday Scott.</q> How, then, can we be sure that this huge book is
not itself another lie to the mother it is dedicated to? Is
<span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> somebody always in the process of symbolically
killing the mother off by telling her the lie that we have given
birth to ourselves? On page 460, <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span> is still not sure
what kind of lie she has told. She writes: <q class="refOther">I am suddenly afraid that the mother I have depicted throughout this book is
false.</q> Whose life is this, anyway? This question cannot be
resolved by a book that sees the <q>daughter's search for
identity</q> as the necessity of choosing <i>between</i> symbiosis
and separation, <i>between</i> the mother and the autonomous
self. As long as this polarity remains unquestioned, the
autobiography of <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span> becomes the drawing and redrawing
of the portrait of Jane Colbert Friday Scott. The most truly
autobiographical moments occur not in expressions of triumphant
separation but in descriptions of the way the book itself
attempts to resist its own writing. At the end of the chapter on
loss of virginity, <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span> writes:

<blockquote class="refOther">
It took me twenty-one years to give up my virginity. In some
similar manner I am unable to let go of this chapter.
[...]<br>

It is no accident that wrestling with ideas of loss of virginity
immediately bring me to a dream of losing my mother. This
chapter has revealed a split in me. Intellectually, I think of
myself as a sexual person, just as I had intellectually been
able to put my ideas for this chapter down on paper.
Subjectively, I don't want to face what I have written: that the
declaration of full sexual independence is the declaration of
separation from my mother. As long as I don't finish this
chapter, as long as I don't let myself understand the
implications of what I've written, I can maintain the illusion,
at least, that I can be sexual and have my <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother's love</span> and
approval too. [pp. 331-333]
</blockquote>

As long as sexual identity and mother's judgment are linked as
antithetical and exclusive poles of the daughter's problem, the
<q>split</q> she describes will prevent her from ever completing her
declaration of sexual independence. <q>Full sexual independence</q>
is shown by the book's own resistance to be as illusory and as
mystifying an ideal as the notion of "<span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother love</span>" that <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Friday</span>
so lucidly rejects.</p>


<p><span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span>'s <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographical</span> remarks are more muted, although
her way of letting the reader know that the book was written
partly in mourning for her husband subtly underlies its
persuasive seriousness. In her gesture of rejecting more
traditional forms of scholarship, she pleads not for the
validity but for the urgency of her message:

<blockquote class="refOther">
Right now, what I think is that the kind of work of which this
is an example is centrally necessary work. Whether our
understanding makes a difference or not, we must try to
understand what is threatening to kill us off as fully and
clearly as we can. [...] What [this book] is, then,
is not a scholarly book: it makes no effort to survey the
relevant literature. Not only would that task be (for me)
unmanageably huge. It would also be against my principles. I
believe in reading unsystematically and taking notes
erratically. Any effort to form a rational policy about what to
take in, out of the inhuman flood of printed human utterance
that pours over us daily, feels to me like a self-deluded
exercise in pseudomastery. [pp. viii-ix]
</blockquote>

The typographical form of this book bears out this belief in
renouncing the appearance of mastery: there are two kinds of
footnotes, some at the foot of the page and some at the back of
the book; there are sections between chapters with unaligned
right-hand margins which are called <q class="refOther">Notes toward the next
chapter.</q> And there are bold-face inserts which dialogue with
the controversial points in the main exposition. Clearly, great
pains have been taken to let as many seams as possible show in
the fabric of the argument. The preface goes on:

<blockquote class="refOther">
I mention these limitations in a spirit not of apology but of
warning. To the extent that it succeeds in communicating its
point at all, this book will necessarily enrage the reader. What
it says is emotionally threatening. (<i>Part of why it has taken
me so long to finish it is that I am threatened by it
myself</i>.) [p. ix; emphasis mine]
</blockquote>

My book is roughly sutured, says <span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span>, and it is
threatening. This description sounds uncannily like a
description of <span class="character" about="the creature">Victor Frankenstein's monster</span>. Indeed,
<span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span> goes on to warn the reader not to be tempted to
avoid the threatening message by pointing to superficial flaws
in its physical make-up. The reader of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>,
too, would be well advised to look beyond <span class="character" about="the creature">the monster</span>'s
physical deformity, both for his fearsome power and for his beauty. 
There are indeed numerous ways in which <span class="literaryWork" about="The Mermaid and the Minotaur"><i>The Mermaid and the Minotaur</i></span> can be seen as a modern rewriting of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>.</p>


<p><span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dinnerstein</span>'s book situates its plea for two-sex parenting
firmly in an apparently twentieth-century double bind: the realization that the very technological advances that make it
possible to change the structure of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parenthood</span> also threaten to extinguish earthly life altogether. But it is startling to note
that this seemingly contemporary pairing of the question of <span class="concept" about="parenthood">parenthood</span> with a love-hate relation to technology is already at
work in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel, where the spectacular scientific
discovery of the secrets of animation produces a terrifyingly
vengeful creature who attributes his evil impulses to his
inability to find or to become a parent. Subtitled <q>The Modern
Prometheus</q>, <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> itself indeed refers back to a
myth that already links scientific ambivalence with the origin of mankind. <span class="character" about="Prometheus">Prometheus</span>,
the fire bringer, the giver of both creation and destruction, is also said by some accounts to be the father of the human race.
Ambivalence toward technology can thus be seen as a displaced version of the love-hate relation we have toward our own
<span class="concept" about="parenthood">children</span>.</p>


<p>It is only recently that critics have begun to see <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>'s disgust at the sight of his creation as a study of postpartum depression, as a representation of maternal rejection of a newborn infant, and to relate the entire novel to 
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s mixed feelings about <span class="concept" about="motherhood">motherhood</span>.<a href="#1"><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></a> 
Having lived through an <span class="concept" about="motherhood">unwanted pregnancy</span> from a man married to someone else
only to see that baby die, followed by a second baby named
William -- which is the name of <span class="character" about="William">the Monster's first murder
victim</span> -- <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>, at the age of only eighteen, must have
had excruciatingly divided emotions. Her own mother, indeed, had died upon giving her birth. The idea that a mother can loathe,
fear, and reject her baby has until recently been one of the most repressed of psychoanalytical insights, although it is of
course already implicit in the story of <span class="character" about="Oedipus">Oedipus</span>, whose parents cast him out as an infant to die. What is threatening about each
of these books is the way in which its critique of the <span class="concept" about="motherhood">role of the mother</span> touches on primitive terrors of the mother's
rejection of the child. Each of these <span class="concept" about="gender">women writers</span> does in her way reject the child as part of her coming to grips with the
untenable nature of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother love</span>: <span class="person" about="Nancy Friday">Nancy Friday</span> decides not to
have children, <span class="person" about="Dorothy Dinnerstein">Dorothy Dinnerstein</span> argues that men as well
as women should do the mothering, and <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> describes a
parent who flees in disgust from the repulsive being to whom he has just given birth.</p>


<p>Yet it is not merely in its depiction of the ambivalence of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">motherhood</span> that <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel can be read as <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographical</span>. In the introductory note added in 1831, she writes:

<blockquote class="refFrankenstein">
The publishers of the standard novels, in selecting <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>
for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish
them with some account of the origin of the story. I am the more
willing to comply because I shall thus give a general answer to
the question so very frequently asked me-how I, then a young
girl, came to think of and to dilate upon so very hideous an
idea. [p. vii]
</blockquote>

As this passage makes clear, readers of <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel had
frequently expressed the feeling that a young girl's fascination with the idea of <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> was somehow monstrous in itself.
When <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> ends her introduction to the re-edition of her novel
with the words: <q class="refFrankenstein">And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper</q>, the reader begins to suspect that there
may perhaps be meaningful parallels between <span class="character" about="the creature">Victor's creation</span> of his monster and <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s creation of her book.</p>


<p>Such parallels are indeed unexpectedly pervasive. The impulse to write the book and the desire to search for the secrets of
animation both arise under the same seemingly trivial circumstances: the necessity of finding something to read on a rainy day. 
During inclement weather on a family vacation, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span> happens upon the writings of <span class="person" about="Cornelius Agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</span>, and is immediately fired with the longing to penetrate the secrets of
life and death. Similarly, it was during a wet, ungenial summer in <span class="place" about="Switzerland">Switzerland</span> that <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>, <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>, <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span>, and several others picked
up a volume of ghost stories and decided to write a collection of spine-tingling tales of their own. Moreover, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s discovery of the subject she would write about is described in almost exactly the same words as <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s discovery of the principle of life: <q class="refFrankenstein">Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me</q> [p. xi], writes <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> in her introduction, while <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> says: <q class="refFrankenstein">From the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me</q> [p. 51]. In both cases the sudden flash of inspiration must be supported by the meticulous
gathering of heterogeneous, ready-made materials: <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> collects bones and organs; <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> records overheard discussions of scientific questions that lead her to her sudden vision of
<span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrous</span> creation. <q>Invention</q>, she writes of the process of
writing, but her words apply equally well to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s
labors, <q class="refFrankenstein">invention ... does not consist in creating
out of the void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the
first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless
substances but cannot bring into being the substance itself</q> [p. x]. Perhaps the most
revealing indication of <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s identification of <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s
activity with her own is to be found in her use of the word
<q>artist</q> on two different occasions to qualify the <q class="refFrankenstein">pale student
of unhallowed arts": his success would terrify the
<i>artist</i></q> [p. xi], she writes of the catastrophic moment of creation, while
<span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> confesses to <span class="character" about="Robert Walton">Walton</span>: <q class="refFrankenstein">I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome
trade than an <i>artist</i> occupied by his favorite employment</q>
[p. 55].</p>


<p><span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, in other words, can be read as the story of
the experience of writing <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>. What is at stake
in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s introduction as well as in the novel is the
description of a <i>primal scene of creation</i>. <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i>
combines a monstrous answer to two of the most fundamental
questions one can ask: where do babies come from? and where do
stories come from? In both cases, the scene of creation is
described, but the answer to these questions is still
withheld.</p>


<p>But what can <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>'s workshop of filthy creation
teach us about the specificity of <span class="concept" about="gender"><i>female</i> authorship</span>? At
first sight, it would seem that <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> is much more
striking for its avoidance of the question of femininity than
for its insight into it. All the interesting, complex characters
in the book are male, and their deepest attachments are to other
males. The females, on the other hand, are beautiful, gentle,
selfless, boring nurturers and victims who never experience
inner conflict or true desire. <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">Monstrousness</span> is so incompatible
with femininity that <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> cannot even complete the
female companion that his creature so eagerly awaits.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the story of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> is,
after all, the story of a man who usurps the <span class="concept" about="gender">female role</span> by physically giving birth to a child. It would be tempting,
therefore, to conclude that <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>, surrounded as she then
was by the male poets <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span> and <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>, and mortified for days
by her inability to think of a story to contribute to their
ghost-story contest, should have fictively transposed her own
frustrated female pen envy into a tale of catastrophic <span class="concept" about="gender">male womb
envy</span>. In this perspective, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s book would suggest that a
woman's desire to write and a man's desire to give birth would
both be capable only of <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">producing monsters</span>.</p>


<p>Yet clearly things cannot be so simple. As the daughter of a
famous feminist whose <span class="literaryWork" about="Vindication of the Rights of Women"><i>Vindication of the Rights of
Women</i></span> she was in the process of rereading during the time she was writing <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> would have no reason to believe that writing was not proper for a woman. 
Indeed, as she says in her introduction, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> was practically born with ink flowing through her veins:

<blockquote class="refFrankenstein">
It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of
distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life
have thought of writing. [...] My husband
[...] was from the first very anxious that I should
prove myself worthy of my parentage and enroll myself on the

In order to prove herself worthy of her parentage, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>,
paradoxically enough, must thus usurp <span class="concept" about="parenthood">the parental role</span> and
succeed in giving birth to herself on paper. Her declaration of
existence as a writer must therefore figuratively repeat the
matricide that her physical birth all too literally entailed.
The connection between literary creation and the death of a
parent is in fact suggested in the novel by the fact that,
immediately after the monster's animation, <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</span>
dreams that he holds the corpse of his dead mother in his arms
[1.4.2]. It is also suggested by the juxtaposition of two seemingly unrelated uses of italics
in the novel: <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s statement that she had <i>thought of a
story</i> (which she inexplicably underlines twice) and the
<span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>'s promise to <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>, <i>I will be with you on your
wedding night</i> [3.3.4], which is repeatedly italicized. Both are eliminations of the
mother, since the story Mary writes is a tale of motherless
birth, and the wedding night marks the death of <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s
bride, <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span>. Indeed, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> herself was in fact the unwitting
murderous intruder present on her own parents' wedding night:
their decision to marry was due to the fact that <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span> was already carrying the child that was to kill
her. When <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>, describing her waking vision of catastrophic
creation, affirms that <q class="refOther">His success would terrify the artist,</q>
she is not giving vent to any ordinary fear-of-success syndrome.
Or rather, what her book suggests is that what is at stake
behind what is currently being banalized under the name of
female fear of success is nothing less than the fear of somehow
effecting the death of one's own parents.</p>


<p>It is not, however, the necessary murderousness of any
declaration of <span class="concept" about="gender">female subjectivity</span> that <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel is
proposing as its most troubling message of <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monsterdom</span>. For, in a
strikingly contemporary sort of predicament, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> had not one
but two mothers, each of whom consisted in the knowledge of the
unviability of the other. After the death of <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s
father <span class="person" about="William Godwin">William Godwin</span>
married <span class="person" about="Mary Jane Clairmont Godwin">a woman</span> as opposite in character and outlook as possible, a staunch housewifely
mother of two who clearly preferred her own children to
<span class="person" about="William Godwin">Godwin</span>'s. Between the courageous, passionate, intelligent, and
suicidal mother <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> knew only through her writings and the
vulgar, repressive "pustule of vanity" whose dislike she
resented and returned, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> must have known at first hand a
whole gamut of feminine contradictions, impasses, and options.
For the complexities of the demands, desires, and sufferings of
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s life as a woman were staggering. Her father, who had once
been a vehement opponent of the institution of marriage, nearly
disowned his daughter for running away with <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>, an already
married disciple of <span class="person" about="William Godwin">Godwin</span>'s own former views. <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> himself,
who believed in multiple love objects, amicably fostered an
erotic correspondence between <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> and his friend <span class="person" about="Thomas Jefferson Hogg">Thomas Jefferson Hogg</span>, among others. For years, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> and <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> were accompanied everywhere
by <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s stepsister <span class="person" about="Claire Clairmont">Claire</span>,
whom <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> did not particularly like, who had a child by <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span>, and who maintained an ambiguous relation with <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>. During the writing of
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> learned of the suicide of her
half-sister <span class="person" about="Frances Imlay">Fanny Imlay</span>, her mother's illegitimate child by an American lover, and the
suicide of <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>'s wife <span class="person" about="Harriet Westbrook">Harriet</span>, who was pregnant by
a man other than <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>. By the time she and <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> married,
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> had had two children; she would have two more by the time
of <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>'s death, and would watch as all but one of the
children died in infancy. Widowed at age 24, she never remarried. It is thus indeed perhaps the very hiddenness of the
question of femininity in <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> that somehow
proclaims the painful message not of female <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> but of
<span class="concept" about="gender">female contradictions</span>. For it is the fact of self-contradiction
that is so vigorously repressed in women. While the story of a
man who is haunted by his own contradictions is representable as
an allegory of <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrous</span> doubles, how indeed would it have been
possible for <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> to represent <span class="concept" about="gender">feminine contradiction</span> <i>from
the point of view of its repression</i> otherwise than precisely
in the <i>gap</i> between angels of domesticity and an
uncompleted monsteress, between the murdered <span class="character" about="Elizabeth Lavenza">Elizabeth</span> and the
dismembered <span class="character" about="Eve">Eve?</span></p>


<p>It is perhaps because the novel does succeed in conveying the
unresolvable contradictions inherent in <span class="concept" about="gender">being female</span> that
<span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> himself felt compelled to write a prefatory disclaimer
in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s name before he could let loose his wife's hideous
progeny upon the world. In a series of denials jarringly at odds
with the daring negativity of the novel, <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> places the
following words in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s mouth:

<blockquote class="refFrankenstein">
I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever
moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it
contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this
respect has been limited to [...] the exhibition of
the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of
universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the
character and situation of the hero are by no means to be
conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any
inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as
prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind. [pp. xiii-xiv]
</blockquote>

How is this to be read except as a gesture of repression of the
very specificity of the <span class="concept" about="gender">power of feminine contradiction</span>, a
gesture reminiscent of <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s destruction of his nearly completed female monster? What is being repressed here is
the possibility that a woman can write anything that would
<i>not</i> exhibit <q>the amiableness of domestic affection</q>, the
possibility that for women as well as for men the home can be
the very site of the <i>unheimlich</i>.</p>


<p>It can thus be seen in all three of the books we have discussed
that the <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrousness</span> of selfhood is intimately embedded within
the question of female <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span>. Yet how could it be
otherwise, since the very notion of a self, the very shape of
human life stories, has always, from <span class="person" about="St. Augustine">St. Augustine</span> to <span class="person" about="Sigmund Freud">Freud</span>,
been <span class="concept" about="gender">modeled on the man</span>? <span class="person" about="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Rousseau</span>'s -- or any man's
-- autobiography consists precisely in the story of the
difficulty of conforming to the standard of what a <i>man</i>
should be. The problem for the <span class="concept" about="gender">female</span> <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiographer</span> is, on the
one hand, to resist the pressure of <span class="concept" about="gender">masculine</span> <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> as
the only literary genre available for her enterprise, and, on
the other, to describe a difficulty in conforming to a <span class="concept" about="gender">female ideal</span> which is largely a fantasy of the masculine, not the
feminine, imagination. The fact that these three books deploy a <i>theory</i> of <span class="concept" about="autobiography">autobiography</span> as <span class="concept" about="monstrosity">monstrosity</span> within the framework of a less overtly avowed struggle with the raw materials of the authors' own lives and writing is perhaps, in
the final analysis, precisely what is most autobiographically fertile and <i>telling</i> about them.
