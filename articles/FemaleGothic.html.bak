			<blockquote>

A baby at birth is usually disappointing-looking to a parent who
hasn't seen one before. His skin is coated with wax, which, if
left on, will be absorbed slowly and will lessen the chance of
rashes. His skin underneath is apt to be very red. His face
tends to be puffy and lumpy, and there may be black-and-blue
marks.
... The head is misshapen ... Low in the
forehead, elongated at the back, and quite lopsided.
Occasionally there may be, in addition, a hematoma, a localized
hemorrhage under the scalp that sticks out as a distinct bump
and takes weeks to go away. A couple of days after birth there
may be a touch of jaundice, which is visible for about a week.
... The baby's body is covered all over with fuzzy
hair. ... For a couple of weeks afterward there is
apt to be a dry scaling of the skin, which is also shed. Some
babies have black hair on the scalp at first, which may come far
down on the forehead....

<p>What I mean by <span class="concept" about="female gothic">Female Gothic</span> is easily defined: the work that
women writers have done in the literary mode that, since the
eighteenth century, we have called <span class="concept" about="gothic">the Gothic</span>. But what I mean
-- or anyone else means -- by "<span class="concept" about="gothic">the Gothic</span>" is not so easily
stated except that it has to do with fear. In <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> writings
fantasy predominates over reality, the strange over the
commonplace, and the supernatural over the natural, with one
definite auctorial intent: to scare. Not, that is, to reach down
into the depths of the soul and purge it with pity and terror
(as we say tragedy does), but to get to the body itself, its
glands, muscles, epidermis, and circulatory system, quickly
arousing and quickly allaying the physiological reactions to
fear.</p>

<p>Certainly the earliest tributes to the power of <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> writers
tended to emphasize the physiological. <span class="person" about="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</span> has <span class="character" about="Henry Tilney">Henry Tilney</span>,
in <span class="literaryWork" about="Northanger Abbey"><i>Northanger Abbey</i></span>, say that he could not put down <span class="person" about="Ann Radcliffe">Mrs. Radcliffe</span>'s <span class="literaryWork" about="Mysteries of Udolpho"><i>Mysteries
of Udolpho</i></span>: "I remember finishing it in two days -- my hair
standing on end the whole time." According to <span class="person" about="William Hazlitt">Hazlitt</span>, <span class="person" about="Ann Radcliffe">Ann
Radcliffe</span> had mastered "the art of freezing the blood":
"harrowing up the soul with imaginary horrors, and making the
flesh creep and the nerves thrill." And <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> said she
intended <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> to be the kind of ghost story that
would "curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart."
Why such claims? Presumably because readers enjoyed these
sensations. For example, in a work the Shelleys knew well, <span class="person" about="Joanna Baillie">Joanna Baillie</span>'s verse play on
the theme of addiction to artificial fear, the heroine prevails
upon a handmaiden, against the best advice, to tell a horror
story:</p>

<blockquote>

... Tell it, I
pray thee.<br>

And let me cow'ring stand, and be my touch<br>

The valley's ice: there is a pleasure in it.<br>

Yea, when the cold blood shoots through every vein;<br>

When every pore upon my shrunken skin<br>

A knotted knoll becomes, and to mine ears<br>

Strange inward sounds awake, and to mine eyes<br>

Rush stranger tears, there is a joy in fear.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>At the time when literary <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> was born, religious fears were
on the wane, giving way to that vague paranoia of the modern
spirit for which <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> mechanisms seem to have provided welcome
therapy. <span class="person" about="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</span>
compared reading <span class="person" about="Ann Radcliffe">Mrs.
Radcliffe</span> to taking drugs, dangerous when habitual "but of
most blessed power in those moments of pain and of languor, when
the whole head is sore, and the whole heart sick. If those who
rail indiscriminately at this species of composition, were to
consider the quantity of actual pleasure which it produces, and
the much greater proportion of real sorrow and distress which it
alleviates, their philanthropy ought to moderate their critical
pride, or religious intolerance." A grateful public rewarded
<span class="person" about="Ann Radcliffe">Mrs. Radcliffe</span> by making her the most popular and best paid
English novelist of the eighteenth century. Her preeminence
among the "Terrorists", as they were called, was hardly
challenged in her own day, and modern readers of <span class="literaryWork" about="Mysteries of Udolpho"><i>Udolpho</i></span>
and <span class="literaryWork" about="The Italian"><i>The Italian</i></span> continue to hail her as mistress of the
pure <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> form.</p>


<p>As early as the 1790s, <span class="person" about="Ann Radcliffe">Ann Radcliffe</span> firmly set the <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> in
one of the ways it would go ever after: a novel in which the
central figure is a young woman who is simultaneously persecuted
victim and courageous heroine. But what are we to make of the
next major turning of the <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> tradition that a woman brought
about, a generation later? <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>,
in 1818, made the
<span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> novel over into what today we call <span class="concept" about="science fiction">science fiction</span>.
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> brought a new sophistication to literary terror,
and it did so without a heroine, without even an important
female victim. Paradoxically, however, no other <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> work by a
woman writer, perhaps no literary work of any kind by a woman,
better repays examination in the light of the sex of its author.
For <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> is a birth myth, and one that was lodged in the
novelist's imagination, I am convinced, by the fact that <span class="concept" about="motherhood">she was herself a mother</span>.</p>


<p>Much in <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s life was remarkable. She was the
daughter of a brilliant mother (<span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span>) and
father (<span class="person" about="William Godwin">William Godwin</span>). She
was the mistress and then wife of the poet <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>. She read widely
in five languages, including Latin and Greek. She had easy
access to the writings and conversation of some of the most
original minds of her age. But nothing so sets her apart from
the generality of writers of her own time, and before, and for
long afterward, than her early and chaotic experience, at the
very time she became an author, with <span class="concept" about="motherhood">motherhood</span>. Pregnant at
sixteen, and almost constantly pregnant throughout the following
five years; yet not a secure mother, for she lost most of her
babies soon after they were born; and not a lawful mother, for
she was not married -- not at least when, at the age of
eighteen, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Godwin</span> began to write <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>. So
are monsters born.</p>


<p>What in fact has the <span class="concept" about="motherhood">experience of giving birth</span> to do with
women's literature? In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
relatively few important women writers bore children; most of
them, in England and America, were spinsters and virgins. With
the coming of <span class="concept" about="naturalism">Naturalism</span> late in the century, and the lifting of
the Victorian taboo against writing about physical sexuality
(including <span class="concept" about="motherhood">pregnancy and labor</span>), the subject of birth was first
brought to literature in realistic form by the male novelists,
from <span class="person" about="Lev Tolstoy">Tolstoy</span> and <span class="person" about="Emil Zola">Zola</span> to <span class="person" about="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</span>. <span class="person" about="Lev Tolstoy">Tolstoy</span> was
the father of thirteen babies born at home; <span class="person" about="William Carlos Williams">Williams</span>, as well as
a poet and a <span class="concept" about="naturalism">Naturalist</span>, was a small-town doctor with hundreds
of deliveries to his professional credit, and thus well equipped
to write the remarkable account of a birth that opens <span class="literaryWork" about="The White Mule"><i>The
White Mule</i></span>. For knowledge of the sort that makes half a
dozen pages of obstetrical detail, they had the advantage over
woman writers until relatively recent times.<a href="#1"><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></a></p> <!-- <span data-toggle="modal" data-target="#note1" class="note">[1]</span> -->


<p><span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> was a unique case, in literature as in life.
She brought birth to fiction not as realism but as <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic
fantasy</span>, and thus contributed to <span class="concept" about="romanticism">Romanticism</span> a myth of
genuine originality: the mad scientist who locks himself in his
laboratory and secretly, guiltily works at creating human life,
only to find that he has made a monster.

<blockquote>
It was on a dreary night of
November, that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With
an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the
instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of
being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.
... The rain pattered dismally against the panes, and
my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the
creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion
agitated its limbs. ... His yellow skin scarcely
covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was
of a lustrous black, and flowing ... but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery
eyes, that seemed almost of the same color as the dun white
sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and
straight black lips.
</blockquote>

That is very good <span class="concept" about="horror">horror</span>, but what follows is more horrid
still: <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>, the scientist, runs away and abandons the
newborn <span class="character" about="the creature">monster</span>, who is and remains nameless. Here, I think, is
where Mary Shelley's book is most interesting, most powerful,
and most feminine: in the motif of revulsion against newborn
life, and the drama of guilt, dread, and flight surrounding
birth and its consequences. Most of the novel, roughly two of
its three volumes, can be said to deal with the retribution
visited upon monster and creator for deficient infant care.
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> seems to be distinctly a woman's mythmaking on <span class="concept" about="motherhood">the subject
of birth</span> precisely because its emphasis is not upon what
precedes birth, not upon birth itself, but upon what follows
birth: the trauma of the afterbirth.</p>


<p>Fear and guilt, depression and anxiety are commonplace reactions
to <span class="concept" about="motherhood">the birth of a baby</span>, and well within the normal range of
experience. But more deeply rooted in our cultural mythology,
and certainly in our literature, are the <span class="concept" about="motherhood">happy maternal
reactions</span>: the ecstasy, the sense of fulfillment, and the rush
of nourishing love which sweep over the new mother when she
first holds her baby in her arms. <span class="person" about="William Thackeray">Thackeray</span>'s treatment of the
birth of a baby in <span class="literaryWork" about="Vanity Fair"><i>Vanity Fair</i></span> is the classic of this
genre: gentle <span class="character" about="Amelia Sedley">Amelia</span> is <span class="concept" about="motherhood">pregnant</span> when her adored young husband
dies on the field of <span class="place" about="Waterloo">Waterloo</span>, a tragedy which drives the young
woman into a state of comatose grief until the blessed moment when her baby is born. "Heaven had sent her consolation,"
writes <span class="person" about="William Thackeray">Thackeray</span>. "A day came -- of almost terrified delight and
wonder -- when the poor widowed girl <span class="concept" about="motherhood">pressed a child upon her
breast</span>... a little boy, as beautiful as a cherub... Love, and hope, and prayer woke again in her
bosom... She was safe."</p>


<p><span class="person" about="William Thackeray">Thackeray</span> was here recording a reality, as well as expressing a
sentiment. But he himself was under no illusion that happiness
was the only possible maternal reaction to giving birth, for his
own wife had become depressed and hostile <span class="concept" about="motherhood">after their first baby
was born</span>, and suicidal after the last; at the time of <span class="literaryWork" about="Vanity Fair"><i>Vanity
Fair</i></span>, <span class="person" about="William Thackeray">Thackeray</span> had already had to place her in a
sanitarium, and he was raising their two little girls himself.
So, in  <span class="literaryWork" about="Vanity Fair"><i>Vanity Fair</i></span>, he gives us not only <span class="character" about="Amelia Sedley">Amelia</span> as a
<span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother</span>, but also <span class="character" about="Rebecca Sharp">Becky Sharp</span>. <span class="character" about="Rebecca Sharp">Becky</span>'s cold disdain toward her
infant son, her hostility and selfishness as a <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother</span>, are
perhaps a legacy of <span class="person" about="William Thackeray">Thackeray</span>'s experience; they are among the
finest things in the novel.</p>


<p>From what we know about the strange young woman who wrote
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> was in this respect nothing
like <span class="character" about="Rebecca Sharp">Becky Sharp</span>. She rejoiced at becoming a mother and loved
and cherished her babies as long as they lived. But her journal,
which has set the tone of most of the discussion of the genesis
of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, is a chilly and laconic document in
which the overwhelming emphasis is not on <span class="concept" about="motherhood">her maternity</span> but on
the extraordinary reading program she put herself through at <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>'s side. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary
Shelley</span> is said -- and rightly -- to have absorbed into
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> the ideas about education, society, and
morality held by <span class="person" about="William Godwin">her father</span>
and <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">her mother</span>. She is
shown to have been influenced directly by <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>'s genius, and
by her reading of <span class="person" about="Samuel Coleridge">Coleridge</span> and <span class="person" about="William Wordsworth">Wordsworth</span> and the <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic novelists</span>. She learned
from <span class="person" about="Humphry Davy">Sir Humphry Davy</span>'s book on
<span class="concept" about="chemistry">chemistry</span> and <span class="person" about="Erasmus Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</span> on <span class="concept" about="biology">biology</span>. In <span class="place" about="Switzerland">Switzerland</span>, the summer she
began <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, she sat by while <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>, <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span>, and <span class="person" about="John Polidori">Polidori</span> discussed the new
sciences of mesmerism, <span class="concept" about="electricity">electricity</span>, and <span class="concept" about="galvanism">galvanism</span>, which promised to
unlock the riddle of life, and planned to write ghost stories.</p>


<p><span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> herself was the first to point to her fortuitous
immersion in the literary and scientific revolutions of her day
as the source of <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>. Her extreme youth, as well
as her sex, have contributed to the generally held opinion that
she was not so much an author in her own right as a transparent
medium through which passed the ideas of those around her. "All
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mrs. Shelley</span> did," writes <span class="person" about="Mario Praz">Mario Praz</span>, "was to provide a passive
reflection of some of the wild fantasies which were living in
the air about her."</p>


<p>Passive reflections, however, do not produce original works of
literature, and <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, if not a great novel, was
unquestionably an original one. The major <span class="concept" about="romanticism">Romantic</span> and minor
<span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> tradition to which it <i>should</i> have belonged was to
the literature of the <span class="concept" about="the overreacher">overreacher</span>: the super man who
breaks through normal human limitations to defy the rules of
society and infringe upon the realm of God. In the <span class="literaryWork" about="Faust">Faust</span> story, hypertrophy of
the individual will is symbolized by a pact with the devil.
<span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span>'s and <span class="person" about="Honoré de Balzac">Balzac</span>'s heroes; the rampaging monks of <span class="person" about="Matthew Lewis">Mat Lewis</span> and <span class="person" about="Ernst Hoffmann">E. T. A. Hoffmann</span>;
the Wandering Jew and
Melmoth the wanderer; the chained and unchained Prometheus: all are
overreachers, all are punished by their own excesses -- by a
surfeit of sensation, of experience, of knowledge and, most
typically, by the doom of eternal life.</p>


<p>But <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s <span class="concept" about="the overreacher">overreacher</span> is different. <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s
exploration of the forbidden boundaries of human science does
not cause the prolongation and extension of his own life, but
the creation of a new one. He defies mortality not by living
forever, but by giving birth. That this original twist to an old
myth should have been the work of a young woman who was also a
<span class="concept" about="motherhood">young mother</span> seems to me, after all, not a very surprising
answer to the question that,
according to <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> herself, was asked from the start:
"How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon,
so very hideous an idea?"</p>


<p>Birth is a hideous thing in <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, even before
there is a monster. For <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s procedure, once he has
determined to create new life, is to frequent the vaults and
charnel houses and study the human corpse in all its loathsome
stages of decay and decomposition. "To examine the causes of life,"
he says, "we must first have recourse to death." His purpose is
to "bestow animation upon lifeless matter," so that he might "in the process of time
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to
corruption." <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> collects bones and other human parts
from the slaughterhouse and the dissecting room, and through
long months of feverish and guilty activity sticks them together
in a frame of gigantic size in what he calls "my workshop of
filthy creation."</p>


<p>It is in her journal and her letters that <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> reveals
the workshop of her own creation, where she pieced together the
materials for a new species of <span class="concept" about="romanticism">romantic mythology</span>. They record a
<span class="concept" about="horror">horror story</span> of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">maternity</span> of the kind that literary biography
does not provide again until <span class="person" about="Sylvia Plath">Sylvia Plath</span>.</p>


<p>As far as I can figure out, <span class="concept" about="motherhood">she was pregnant</span>, barely pregnant
but aware of the fact, when at the age of sixteen she ran off
with <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> in July 1814. Also pregnant at
the same time was Shelley's legal wife <span class="person" about="Harriet Westbrook">Harriet</span>, who gave birth in
November "to a son and possible heir," as <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> noted in her journal. In February
1815 <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> gave birth to a daughter, illegitimate, premature, and
sickly. There is nothing in the journal about domestic help or a
nurse in attendance. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> notes that she breast-fed the baby;
that <span class="person" about="Frances Imlay">Fanny</span>, her half sister,
came to call; that <span class="person" about="Claire Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</span>, her stepsister, who had run off with <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>, kept Shelley amused. <span class="person" about="Napoleone Bonaparte">Bonaparte</span>
invaded <span class="place" about="France">France</span>, the journal tells us, and <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> took up her incessant reading program: this
time, <span class="person" about="Madame de Staël">Mme de Staël</span>'s
<span class="literaryWork" about="Corinne"><i>Corinne</i></span>. The baby died in March. "Find my baby dead,"
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> wrote. "A miserable day."</p>


<p>In April 1815 <span class="concept" about="motherhood">she was pregnant again</span>, about eight weeks after the birth of her
first child. In January 1816 she gave birth to
a son: more breastfeeding, more reading. In March, <span class="person" about="Claire Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</span> sought out <span class="person" about="George Byron">Lord Byron</span> and managed to get herself pregnant by him within a couple of weeks. This pregnancy would
be a subject of embarrassment and strain to <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> and <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>,
and it immediately changed their lives, for <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span> left England
in April, and <span class="person" about="Claire Clairmont">Claire</span>, <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>, and her infant pursued him
to <span class="place" about="Switzerland">Switzerland</span> in May. There is nothing yet in Mary's journal
about a servant, but a good deal about mule travel in the
mountains. In June they all settled near <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span> on the shores of
<span class="place" about="Lake Geneva">Lake Geneva</span>.</p>


<p>In June 1816, also, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> began <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>. And during
the year of its writing, the following events ran their swift
and sinister course: in October <span class="person" about="Frances Imlay">Fanny Imlay</span>, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s half sister,
committed suicide after discovering that she was not <span class="person" about="William Godwin">Godwin</span>'s
daughter but <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span>'s daughter by her American
lover. (The suicide was not only a tragedy but an embarrassment
to all. Godwin refused even to claim Fanny's body, which was
thrown nameless into a pauper's grave.) In early December <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>
was pregnant again, as she seems to have sensed almost the day
it happened. (See her letter to <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span> of December 5, in which
she also announced completion of Chapter 4 of her novel.) In
mid-December <span class="person" about="Harriet Westbrook">Harriet Shelley</span> drowned herself in the Serpentine;
she was pregnant by someone other than <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>. In late December
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> married <span class="person" about="Percy Shelley">Shelley</span>. In January 1817 <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> wrote <span class="person" about="George Byron">Byron</span> that
<span class="person" about="Claire Clairmont">Claire</span> had borne him a daughter. In May she finished
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, published the following year.</p>


<p>Death and birth were thus as hideously intermixed in the life of
<span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> as in <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s "workshop of filthy creation."
Who can read without shuddering, and without remembering her
myth of the birth of a nameless monster, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span>'s journal entry of
March 19, 1815, which records the trauma of her loss, when she
was seventeen, of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">her first baby</span>, the little girl who did not
live long enough to be given a name. "Dream that my little baby
came to life again," <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> wrote; "that it had only been cold,
and that we rubbed it before the fire, and it lived. Awake and
find no baby. I think about the little thing all day. Not in
good spirits." ("<i>I thought,
that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might
in process of time renew life where death had apparently devoted
the body to corruption</i>.")</p>


<p>So little use has been made of this material by writers about
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> that it may be worth emphasizing how
important, because how unusual, was <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</p>'s experience as
a young woman writer. Though the death of one of their babies
played a decisive role in the literary careers of both <span class="person" about="Harriet Beecher Stowe">Harriet
Beecher Stowe</span> and <span class="person" about="Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell">Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell</span>, two of the rare
Victorian women writers who were also <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mothers</span>. both were about twice <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s age when their babies died; and both were respectably settled middle-class women, wives of
ministers. The harum-scarum circumstances surrounding her <span class="concept" about="motherhood">maternity</span> have no parallel until our time, which in its
naïve cerebrations upon family life (and in much else, except genius) resembles the Shelley era. The young women
novelists and poets of today who are finding in the trauma of inexperienced and unassisted <span class="concept" about="motherhood">motherhood</span> a mine of troubled
fantasy and black humor are on the lookout for <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span>
predecessors, if the revival of <span class="literaryWork" about="The Yellow Wallpaper"><i>The Yellow Wallpaper</i></span> --
<span class="person" about="Charlotte Perkins Gilman">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</span>'s macabre post-partum fantasy -- is any
indication. The newborn returns again to literature as monster.

<blockquote>
At six months he grew big as six years<br>

... One day he swallowed<br>

Her whole right breast ...<br>

...both died,<br>

She inside him, curled like an embryo.<br>


<center> -- <span class="person" about="Cynthia Macdonald">Cynthia Macdonald</span>: <span class="literaryWork" about="The Insatiable Baby">"The Insatiable Baby"</span></center>
</blockquote>

Behind them all stands the original fantasy and the exceptional
case of <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>. She hurtled into teen-age <span class="concept" about="motherhood">motherhood</span>
without any of the financial or social or familial supports that made bearing and rearing children a relaxed experience for the
normal middle-class woman of her day (as <span class="person" about="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</span>, for example, described her). She was an unwed mother, responsible
for breaking up a marriage of a young woman just as much a mother as she. The father whom she adored broke furiously with
her when she eloped; and <span class="person" about="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</span>, the mother whose memory she revered, and whose books she was rereading throughout her teen-age years, had died in childbirth -- died giving birth
to <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary</span> herself.</p>


<p>Surely no outside influence need be sought to explain <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s fantasy of the newborn as at once monstrous agent of
destruction and piteous victim of <span class="concept" about="motherhood">parental abandonment</span>. "I, the miserable and the
abandoned," cries <span class="character" about="the creature">the monster</span> at the end of
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, "I am an abortion to be spurned at, and
kicked, and trampled on. ... I have murdered the
lovely and the helpless. ... I have devoted my
creator to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable
ruin."</p>

<p>In the century and a half since its publication, <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> has spawned innumerable interpretations
among the critics, and among the novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers who have felt its influence. The idea, though not the
name, of the robot originated with <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s novel, and her
title character became a byword for the dangers of scientific knowledge. But the work has also been read as an existential
fable; as a commentary on the cleavage between reason and feeling, in both philosophical thought and educational theory;
as a parable of the excesses of idealism and genius; as a dramatization of the divided self; as an attack on the
stultifying force of social convention, including race prejudice, for <span class="person" about="Stephen Crane">Stephen Crane</span>'s <span class="literaryWork" about="The Monster"><i>The Monster</i></span> must surely be counted among the most powerful descendants of
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>.</p>


<p>The versatility of <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s myth is due to the brilliance
of her mind and the range of her learning, as well as to the influence of the circle in which she moved as a young writer.
But <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> was most original in its dramatization
of dangerous oppositions through the struggle of a creator with monstrous creation. The sources of this <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> conception, which
still has power to "curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings
of the heart, "were surely the anxieties of a woman who, as
daughter, mistress, and <span class="concept" about="motherhood">mother</span>, was a bearer of death.</p>


<p><span class="person" about="Robert Kiely">Robert Kiely</span>'s suggestive study of <span class="literaryWork" about="The Romantic Novel in England"><i>The Romantic Novel in
England</i></span> includes one of the rare serious discussions of
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> as a woman's work. For Professor Kiely does more
than interpret; he also responds, as one must in reading
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span>, to what he calls the "mundane side to this
fantastic tale".


<blockquote>
In making her hero the creator of a monster, she does not
necessarily mock idealistic ambition, but in making that monster
a poor grotesque patchwork, a physical mess of seams and
winkles, she introduces a consideration of the material universe
which challenges and undermines the purity of idealism. In
short, the sheer concreteness of the ugly thing which
Frankenstein has created often makes his ambitions and his
character -- however sympathetically described seem ridiculous
and even insane. The arguments on behalf of idealism and
unworldly genius are seriously presented, but the controlling
perspective is that of an earthbound woman. [p. 160]
</blockquote>

The "mundane side" to <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> is one of its most
fertile and original aspects. <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> comes honestly to
grips with the dilemma of a newly created human being, a giant adult male in shape, who must swiftly recapitulate, and without
the assistance of his terrified parent, the infantile and adolescent stages of human development. She even faces squarely
<span class="character" about="the creature">the monster</span>'s sexual needs, for the denouement of the story hangs on his demand that <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span> create a female monster partner, and <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s refusal to do so.</p>


<p>But more than mundane is <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s concern with the
emotions surrounding the parent-child and child-parent relationship. Here her intention to underline the birth myth in
<span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> becomes most evident, quite apart from
biographical evidence about its author. She provides an unusual thickening of the background of the tale with familial fact and
fantasy, from the very opening of the story in the letters a brother addresses to his sister of whom he is excessively fond,
because they are both orphans. There is <span class="character" about="Victor Frankenstein">Frankenstein</span>'s relationship to his doting parents, and his semi-incestuous
love for an abandoned, orphan girl brought up as his sister.
There is the first of the monster's murder victims, Frankenstein's infant brother (precisely drawn, even to his name, after <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s baby); and the innocent young girl wrongly executed for the infant's murder, who is also a victim
of what <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> calls that "strange perversity," a mother's
hatred. (<span class="character" about="Justine">Justine</span> accepts guilt with docility: "'I almost began
to think that I was the monster that my confessor said I was.
...'" [1.7.7]) The material in <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> about the abnormal, or
monstrous, manifestations of the child-parent tie justifies, as much as does its famous monster, <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span>'s reference to the novel as "my hideous progeny."</p>


<p>What <span class="person" about="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</span> actually did in <span class="literaryWork" about="Frankenstein"><i>Frankenstein</i></span> was to
transform the standard <span class="concept" about="romanticism">Romantic</span> matter of incest, infanticide, and patricide into a phantasmagoria of the nursery. Nothing
quite like it was done in English literature until that Victorian novel by a woman which we also place uneasily in the <span class="concept" about="gothic">Gothic</span> tradition: <span class="literaryWork" about="Wuthering Heights"><i>Wuthering Heights</i></span>.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><h2><a name="1">1.</a> Two very popular women novelists (and Nobel
laureates), Pearl Buck and Sigrid Undset, were probably
responsible for establishing pregnancy, labor, and breast
feeding as themes belonging to twentieth-century women's
literature. The miscarriage is a powerful new theme in the hands
of Jean Rhys and Sylvia Plath, and the unwed mother's labor
inspires a spirited obstetrical chapter ("Don't Have a Baby Till
You Read This") in the memoir of the young poet Nikki Giovanni,
who has a fine sense of the incongruity of the experience. "'A
BABY? BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING A BABY! I'VE NEVER
HAD A BABY BEFORE.' And I started crying and crying and crying.
What if I messed up? You were probably counting on me to do the
right thing and what did I know? I was an intellectual. I
thought things through. I didn't know shit about action."</p>

<p>But Colette's note of skepticism is most worth recalling,
because she was the first to pick and choose for literature
among all the ramifications of female sexuality. In <i>La Maison
de Claudine</i> she tells of fainting away in horror when, as a
young girl, she first came upon a gruesome birth scene in Zola.
"Oh, its not such a terrible thing, the birth of a child," she
has her mother comment. "... The proof that all
women forget it is that it's never anybody but men -- and what
business was it of his, that Zola? -- who make stories about
it."<h2></p>
