                <h3>Women of horror</h3>
                <p>
                    Women of Horror is a magazine that focuses on the intersection between the genre of horror in a
                    broad sense and the the representation and conceptualization of femininity.
                    Every issue gathers critical articles about a particular work of interest or relevant theme,
                    allowing the reader to explore different perspectives and gazes on the same topic, as well as
                    acquire an in-depth theoretical knowledge about women and mostruosity.
                    At the present moment only the issue Electric Monster is available: this issue focuses on the
                    foundational gothic novel <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley and collects interpretations centered
                    around the author's experience as a female writer, drawing illuminating connections, for instance,
                    between monstruosity and motherhood. All present articles were chosen among those available in the
                    critical section of the first <i>Frankenstein</i>'s <a
                        href="http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/index.html" target="_blank">scholarly digital
                        edition</a>.
                    For an enhanced and interactive experience, every issue is provided with a costumized Metadata
                    viewer, higlighting relevant features in each article.
                    <br>
                    Horror is also about esthetic! The reader will be able to experience fear across the centuries
                    thanks to our different historically costumized typography layouts.

                <h4>The eye magazine text as an example for further information to add</h4>
                The Eye Magazine is a project realized for the examination of the course of Information modelling and
                web technologies held by Fabio Vitali within the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital
                Knowledge of the University of Bologna.
                The platform has been developed as a representative framework for reading and exploring the content of
                articles inside a magazine and it was designed with the main goal of easily deploying magazine issues
                according to modern and accurate page design, each nicely presented according to switchable, historical
                documented, typographic themes and enriched with metadata and additional information about the wide
                range of textual content and different media that can be found in the articles. It can be appropriately
                described by the acronym MMMM, which means Metadata Model for Modern Magazines. In fact, it is meant as
                a replicable and guided paradigm that could be theoretically applied to a diverse range of issues of
                multiple publications.
                At the moment of publication, the magazine contains four issues. Each issue is made up of four articles
                selected by an individual member of the editorial team and concerning a specific area of scientific
                investigation. Issues are presented inside a visualizer page, which allows the possibility of navigating
                across the number, switching typographic styles and examining meaningful information from a metadata
                viewer, both for the single article and the related publication. Issues are represented in a tripartite
                form. They include: a cover page, that works as a table of content/index giving access to the documents,
                the corpus of the issue made of articles and a back-cover, used as a disclaimer page specifying the
                scope and purpose of the site and the copyright of the documents. Each article is enriched with metadata
                that refer to its editorial history, its source and the related content information, such as meaningful
                occurrences of people, places, dates, concepts, credits and entities. Information are meant to be
                related, in order to create a complex network of references across articles of the same issue.
                Historical theming is meant to give us a general overview of the evolution of layout design and
                typography styles across the centuries, from the handwritten manuscript form to the automatic reading of
                the future. Each layout has been studied to capture the use of characters, margins, spaces, colors,
                pagination and new media visualization. More detailed information about design choices can be found in
                the documentation of the project.

                    The purpose of this web site is to explore various types of typographic and
                    layout style for text documents, as an end-of-course project for the "Information
                    Modeling and Web technologies" course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities
                    and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, under prof. Fabio Vitali.

                        the whole content of the page will be vertically aligned</li>
                    <li>I will try to write a js that, when screen resizes to md changes the code inside
