                    <p>
                        Women of Horror is a magazine that focuses on the intersection between the genre of
                        horror in a
                        broad sense and the the representation and conceptualization of femininity.
                        Every issue gathers critical articles about a particular work of interest or relevant
                        theme,
                        allowing the reader to explore different perspectives and gazes on the same topic, as
                        well as
                        acquire an in-depth theoretical knowledge about women and mostruosity.
                        At the present moment only the issue Electric Monster is available: this issue focuses
                        on the
                        foundational gothic novel <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley and collects
                        interpretations centered
                        around the author's experience as a female writer, drawing illuminating connections, for
                        instance,
                        between monstruosity and motherhood. All present articles were chosen among those
                        available in the
                        critical section of the first <i>Frankenstein</i>'s <a

                        For an enhanced and interactive experience, every issue is provided with a costumized
                        Metadata
                        viewer, higlighting relevant features in each article.

                        Horror is also about esthetic! The reader will be able to experience fear across the

                        thanks to our different historically costumized typography layouts.

                    <h4>The eye magazine text as an example for further information to add</h4>
                    The Eye Magazine is a project realized for the examination of the course of Information
                    modelling and
                    web technologies held by Fabio Vitali within the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and
                    Digital
                    Knowledge of the University of Bologna.
                    The platform has been developed as a representative framework for reading and exploring the
                    content of
                    articles inside a magazine and it was designed with the main goal of easily deploying
                    magazine issues
                    according to modern and accurate page design, each nicely presented according to switchable,
                    historical
                    documented, typographic themes and enriched with metadata and additional information about
                    the wide
                    range of textual content and different media that can be found in the articles. It can be
                    appropriately
                    described by the acronym MMMM, which means Metadata Model for Modern Magazines. In fact, it
                    is meant as
                    a replicable and guided paradigm that could be theoretically applied to a diverse range of
                    issues of
                    multiple publications.
                    At the moment of publication, the magazine contains four issues. Each issue is made up of
                    four articles
                    selected by an individual member of the editorial team and concerning a specific area of
                    scientific
                    investigation. Issues are presented inside a visualizer page, which allows the possibility
                    of navigating
                    across the number, switching typographic styles and examining meaningful information from a
                    metadata
                    viewer, both for the single article and the related publication. Issues are represented in a
                    tripartite
                    form. They include: a cover page, that works as a table of content/index giving access to
                    the documents,
                    the corpus of the issue made of articles and a back-cover, used as a disclaimer page
                    specifying the
                    scope and purpose of the site and the copyright of the documents. Each article is enriched
                    with metadata
                    that refer to its editorial history, its source and the related content information, such as
                    meaningful
                    occurrences of people, places, dates, concepts, credits and entities. Information are meant
                    to be
                    related, in order to create a complex network of references across articles of the same
                    issue.
                    Historical theming is meant to give us a general overview of the evolution of layout design
                    and
                    typography styles across the centuries, from the handwritten manuscript form to the
                    automatic reading of
                    the future. Each layout has been studied to capture the use of characters, margins, spaces,
                    colors,
                    pagination and new media visualization. More detailed information about design choices can
                    be found in
                    the documentation of the project.

                    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Every h2 title is a Main title <b>with capital letter</b>, in the homepage we have
                            "Latest
                            Issues" and "About" section</li>
                        <li>h3 are subsection titles, for Instance, Inside "AboTut section" we have "Women of
                            horror", "The
                            project" and "Disclaimer"</li>
                        <li>Every container has an id <b>without capital letter</b>that corresponds to the
                            section's h3
                            title ex. "About" has id="about" </li>
                        <li>every row and subsection in general inside a container also has an id, in order to
                            make it
                            easily stylable and recognizable</li>
                        <li>containers have all the same <b>padding set in the css local stylesheet to 5%</b>,
                            in this way
                            the whole content of the page will be vertically aligned</li>
                        <li>I will try to write a js that, when screen resizes to md changes the code inside
                            "carousel-inner"</li>
                        <li>Notes to the text will go in "Modals" every other pop up message will be an "Alert"
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3>To do</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>check that each text has: author(s), title, maybe subtitle, publication date</li>
                        <li>We could add an issue where we implement different js options, such as navigation
                            and metadata
                            enriched and modified by the readers for their own purposes</li>
                        <li>make carousel work for md size screen</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li>In issue page fix margins and background + do js popup for metadata list + link to
                            wikipedia + decide what to put in title section (article's info? or popup section?)
                            and make it (and columns) sticky</li>
                    </ul>
